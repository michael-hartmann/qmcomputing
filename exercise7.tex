We usually think of a measurement as an interaction between an object and a
measuring device. However, there is also another way to measure -- without
interaction.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{images/slit2.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.24]{images/slit.png}
\caption{left: a cat is blocking a slit in a double-slit experiment, right: probability of measuring a photon dependent on position for the single and double-slit experiment}
\end{figure}
Consider a double-slit experiment as seen in Fig. 1. Let $x_0$ be one minimum
of the interference pattern. If we place a detector at $x=x_0$, and let the
source emit photon by photon, then no photon will reach the detector. Now,
consider a cat blocking one of the slits. There is no more interference, hence,
there is a possibility for a photon to reach the detector. If a photon reaches
the detector, the photon has not interacted with the object, yet we know, that
the cat is blocking the slit. We've seen the cat {\it in the dark}.

In the following we will consider interaction-free measurements with
Mach-Zehnder interferometers.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item The Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Fig. 2 consists of two beam splitters
(B1 and B2) and two mirrors (M). The path lengths in the upper and lower arms of
the interferometer are the same.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/ifm1.png}
\caption{Schematic of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.}
\end{figure}

Show that if $R_1$ (reflectivity of the first beam splitter) is the same as $T_2$
(transmittivity of the second beam splitter), then a photon entering the interferometer
from below will always reach the first detector (D1).

{\it Hint:} The relative phase shift between reflected and transmitted waves is $\pi/2$, not $\pi$.

\item Suppose a perfectly absorbing object is placed in the lower arm of the
interferometer as shown in Fig. 3. A photon may reach the first detector as
before, but it also has a chance of either being absorbed by the object or
reaching the second detector. The final possibility is a measurement of the
object's presence without interaction, because light never reaches the second
detector when the object is not persistent.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/ifm2.png}
\caption{The interferometer with an object in one arm.}
\end{figure}

Determine the efficiency of the interaction-free measurement, which is defined
as the ratio of the probability of interaction-free measurement to the
probability of either measurement or absorption as a function of $R_1$. What is
the upper limit of the efficiency?

\item In an improved arrangement, light is reflected through a series of beam
splitters as shown in Fig. 4. If the reflectivity of each beam splitter in the
series is $R=\cos^2(\pi/(2N))$, where $N$ is the number of beam splitters, show
that light will always reach the first detector (D1).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering

\caption{The interferometer described in c) for $N=4$.}
\end{figure}

\item If an object blocks all of the upper arms of the interferometer in Fig. 4, a photon
can also be absorbed or reach the second detector. Determine the efficiency of
interaction-free measurement as a function of the number of beam splitters.
\end{enumerate}
