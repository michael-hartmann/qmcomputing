\caption{The referee distributes the bits $x$ and $y$ to Alice and Bob in the first round. Alice and Bob return the bits $a$ and $b$ to the referee.}
\label{game}
\end{figure}

Alice and Bob play a game. The game begins with a referee selecting two bits
$x$ and $y$ uniformly at random. He then sends $x$ to Alice and $y$ to Bob.
Alice and Bob are not allowed to communicate in any way at this point. Alice
sends back to the referee a bit $a$, and Bob sends back a bit $b$ (see Fig. \ref{game}).
Since they are spatially separated, Alice's bit $a$ can only depend on $x$, and
similarly, Bob's bit $b$ can only depend on $y$. The referee then determines if
the \texttt{AND} of $x$ and $y$ is equal to the \texttt{XOR} of $a$ and $b$. If
so, Alice and Bob win the game. That is, the winning condition is
\begin{equation}
x \wedge y = a \oplus b.
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Make a table that presents the winning conditions depending on the
    various different values of $x$, $y$, $a$ and $b$.

    \item Remember that $a=a(x)$ and $b=b(y)$. What is an optimal strategy and
    what is the maximal winning propability?

    \item Let's assume Alice and Bob share a two-qubit system wich is
    initialized in the Bell state
    \begin{equation}
    \ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \left( \ket{00} + \ket{11}\right).
    \end{equation}
    Alice and Bob agree to use the following strategy:
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Alice takes the first qubit and Bob takes the second qubit from the quantum system.
    \item If Alice receives $x=0$, she does not apply any operation on her
    qubit. If Alice receives $x=1$, she applies a rotation by $\pi/4$.
    \item If Bob receives $y=0$, he applies a rotation by $\pi/8$. If Bob receives $y=1$, he applies a rotation by $-\pi/8$.
    \item Alice and Bob meassure their qubits and output the values obtained as
    their answers $a$ and $b$.
    \end{enumerate}

    What is the winning propability?
\end{enumerate}
